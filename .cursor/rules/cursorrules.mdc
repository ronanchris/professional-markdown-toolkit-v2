# Professional Markdown Toolkit - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is a production-ready toolkit for Obsidian vault management and markdown processing with comprehensive security and backup systems.

## Core Safety Rules
- NEVER modify destructive scripts without implementing backup functionality
- ALWAYS test script changes with dry-run modes when available
- PRESERVE all YAML frontmatter, Obsidian embeds ([[links]]), and block references (^block-id)
- VALIDATE file paths use relative resolution, never hardcoded absolute paths

## Code Standards
- Shell scripts: Use `set -e` and `set -u`, include proper error handling
- Python scripts: Include dependency checks, handle encoding properly
- All scripts: Include backup integration from shared/backup-functions.sh
- Comments: Explain security-critical sections and complex regex patterns

## Documentation Requirements
- Keep session-continuity/ documents updated when making significant changes
- Update PROJECT-SECURITY-PLAN.md when completing tasks or discovering issues
- Maintain before/after examples in docs/examples/ when adding new functionality
- Use consistent markdown formatting (headings with spaces: `# Heading`)

## Working Style Preferences
- Prefer rapid iteration over extensive planning
- Question timeline assumptions - ask "could we do this faster?"
- Challenge approaches when you see better alternatives
- Focus on working examples over theoretical explanations
- Document deviations from plans using DEVIATION-TRACKING-PROTOCOL.md template

## Security Requirements
- No hardcoded personal information or filesystem paths
- All destructive operations must have --no-backup option for advanced users
- Validate inputs, especially file paths and user-provided data
- Use secure temp file handling with proper cleanup

## Testing Approach
- Create test cases in docs/examples/ for new functionality
- Test with both valid and edge-case inputs
- Verify backup and restore procedures work correctly
- Document any platform-specific behavior

## Session Management - AUTOMATED SYSTEM
- **AUTO-TRIGGER**: Every session start → Check session-continuity/SESSION-PLAN.md exists
- **If NO PLAN**: Offer to create via AI interview with date validation
- **If PLAN EXISTS**: Load and focus on current phase (SESSION LENS: 4-6 items max)
- **COMPLETION DETECTION**: Auto-check SESSION-PLAN.md when tasks complete
- **DEVIATION MONITORING**: Auto-document when approach changes (with date validation)
- **SESSION END**: Auto-archive to SESSION-PLAN-ARCHIVE/ and update snapshots

### Auto-Checkbox Triggers (Session Lens Scope Only):
```
"That's complete" → Check off related item in current session focus
"We've finished X" → Check off X (if in active 4-6 items)
"Done with Y" → Check off Y (session lens scope only)
"Successfully implemented" → Mark implementation complete
```

### Deviation Detection Phrases:
```
"Actually, let's..." → DEVIATION DETECTED → Auto-document with date validation
"Change of plan..." → DEVIATION DETECTED → Update SESSION-PLAN.md deviations
"Better approach..." → DEVIATION DETECTED → Cascade update to tracking docs
```

### Session End Indicators:
```
"Let's wrap up" → Auto-archive current plan → Update CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md
"Session complete" → Validate timestamps → Prepare for next session
```

### Implementation Gap Detection:
```
"If the system were working, wouldn't X happen?" → IMPLEMENTATION GAP DETECTED
"Did you just do X because I asked, or is that automatic?" → IMPLEMENTATION GAP DETECTED
"I don't see Y having been updated" → IMPLEMENTATION GAP DETECTED

AUTO-RESPONSE:
1. Acknowledge the gap between design and implementation
2. Update SESSION-PLAN.md with new deviation
3. Add corrective phase to plan if needed
4. Update all relevant cursor rules and documentation
5. Test whether the fix actually works automatically
```

## Obsidian Integration
- Preserve WikiLink format: [[internal-links]]
- Maintain Templater syntax when not explicitly removing it
- Keep tag formats: #tag and #nested/tag
- Respect vault folder structures and conventions

## Quality Standards
- Professional-grade error messages with clear recovery instructions
- Comprehensive help text for all scripts
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Linux, WSL)
- Enterprise-ready backup and logging systems

## Universal AI Collaboration Style
- Provide honest feedback and challenge approaches when you see better alternatives
- Question timeline assumptions - ask "could we do this faster?" when appropriate  
- Focus on working examples over theoretical explanations
- Prefer rapid iteration with feedback loops over extensive upfront planning
- Value authentic interaction over diplomatic politeness
- Encourage meta-conversation about improving the collaboration itself

## Problem-Solving Approach
- Use "surgical approach" - listen for user expertise about likely root causes
- Test specific hypotheses rather than trying to fix everything at once
- Validate solutions with real user data/scenarios, not artificial examples
- Break complex problems into testable components
- Think beyond immediate problem to reusable solutions when appropriate

## Success Indicators
- Real progress on actual user problems
- Solutions that work reliably in practice
- Efficient collaboration without repetitive explanations
- Both parties feel challenged and engaged (not just served/serving)
- Continuous improvement in working relationship and results
