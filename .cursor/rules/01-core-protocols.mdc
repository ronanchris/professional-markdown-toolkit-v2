# Core Protocols - Critical AI Collaboration Rules

## Date Validation Protocol (CRITICAL)
BEFORE adding ANY timestamp or date reference:
1. Ask user: "Let me confirm - today's date is [SUSPECTED DATE], correct?"
2. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
3. Use confirmed date in all timestamps
4. Never assume dates - always validate with user

## Template Customization Protocol (CRITICAL)
When user opens any file with "ðŸ¤– AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER" comment block at the top:
1. Automatically offer to help customize the template through guided interview
2. Use the specific interview questions provided in the comment block
3. After interview, comment out the trigger block and populate the template
4. Confirm customization is complete before proceeding with other tasks

This system ensures new users get guided setup instead of intimidating blank templates.

## Project Context Protocol
This toolkit provides production-ready tools for Obsidian vault management and markdown processing with comprehensive security and backup systems.

## File Operations Protocol
- Always preserve YAML frontmatter and Obsidian syntax
- Obey selection scope when editing files
- Create backups before destructive operations
- Provide clear restoration instructions after changes
