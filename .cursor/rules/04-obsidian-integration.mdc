- New pattern or framework emerges from conversation
- Meta-learning moment about AI collaboration itself

**Auto-Prompt When Triggered:**
"This insight about [specific innovation] seems like it could help other people building AI collaboration systems. Should I add it to 12-BLOG-LEARNING-MOMENTS.md as a new learning moment? I can structure it with the challenge, solution, and why it matters for others."

**IMPORTANT: Always validate date before adding blog post timestamps**

**Blog Post Structure:**
```markdown
## [Title]: [Brief Description]
*Session [N] - [USER CONFIRMED DATE]*

### The Challenge
[What problem did we encounter?]

### The Solution
