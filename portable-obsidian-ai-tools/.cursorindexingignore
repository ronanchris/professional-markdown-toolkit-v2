# .cursorindexingignore
# Performance optimization for Cursor AI indexing
# 
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
# - Prevents Cursor from indexing large/irrelevant files
# - Speeds up AI context loading and search
# - Reduces memory usage and improves responsiveness
# 
# HOW TO USE:
# 1. Add patterns for files/folders you want Cursor to ignore
# 2. Use glob patterns (* and **) for flexible matching
# 3. One pattern per line
# 4. Lines starting with # are comments
# 
# WHEN TO IGNORE FILES:
# ✓ Large generated files (logs, exports, caches)
# ✓ Test data and mock content
# ✓ Archive/backup folders
# ✓ Binary files (images, videos, executables)
# ✓ Temporary files and build artifacts
# ✗ Don't ignore: Source code, documentation, config files you actively edit

# =================================================================
# SAMPLE PATTERNS (Uncomment and customize as needed)
# =================================================================

# Large test data and examples
# test-cases/*/original/*
# test-cases/*/processed/*
# docs/examples/before/*
# docs/examples/after/*

# Generated documentation and exports
# **/*-GENERATED.md
# **/*-EXPORT.*
# PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md

# Archive and backup folders
# SESSION-PLAN-ARCHIVE/
# **/backups/
# **/archives/
# **/.backup-*

# Large logs and cache files
# **/*.log
# **/*.cache
# **/node_modules/
# **/.git/
# **/__pycache__/

# CRITICAL: Cursor rules (prevents caching issues)

# Binary and media files
# **/*.pdf
# **/*.png
# **/*.jpg
# **/*.jpeg
# **/*.gif
# **/*.mp4
# **/*.zip
# **/*.tar.gz

# Temporary and system files
# **/.DS_Store
# **/Thumbs.db
# **/*.tmp
# **/*.temp
# **/~$*

# Large database exports or data dumps
# **/*.sql
# **/*.db
# **/*.sqlite
# **/data-exports/

# PERFORMANCE TIPS:
# =================================================================
# 
# 1. START SMALL: Begin with obvious large files, add more as needed
# 2. TEST IMPACT: Use Cursor's "Reload Window" after changes to test performance
# 3. BALANCE: Don't ignore files you actively work with
# 4. PROJECT-SPECIFIC: Customize patterns for your specific project needs
# 5. TEAM SHARING: Include this file in git for team consistency
# 
# COMMON SIGNS YOU NEED MORE IGNORES:
# - Cursor feels slow when loading context
# - AI searches return too many irrelevant results  
# - Memory usage is high during AI operations
# - Context loading takes a long time
