## Sample Learning Moment

*Here's an example of how to document a learning moment:*

## Template Interview System: Transforming Generic Tools into Guided Experiences
*Session 1 - [TODAY'S DATE]*

### The Challenge
Generic templates and tools often intimidate new users. People see powerful capabilities but struggle with the "blank page problem" - not knowing how to start or customize tools for their specific needs.

### The Solution
**AI Interview Trigger System** - Embed intelligent prompts in template files that automatically offer guided customization:
- HTML comments with specific interview questions
- AI detects triggers and offers conversational setup
- Templates transform from intimidating to welcoming
- Users get personalized, ready-to-use configurations

### Why This Matters for Others
If you're building tools or templates:
- **Solve the adoption barrier** - guided setup vs. overwhelming options
- **Make tools conversational** - transform configuration into dialogue
- **Design for first-time users** - even if you built it, others need different entry points
- **Embed intelligence in documents** - put help where it's needed

### The Meta-Learning
The shift from "here are tools" to "let me help you get started" fundamentally changes user experience. The best tools aren't just powerful - they're approachable.
