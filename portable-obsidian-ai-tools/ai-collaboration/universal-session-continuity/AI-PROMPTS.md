ðŸ¤– AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER
When a user opens this document, automatically offer to help customize it through an interview.

AI ASSISTANT PROMPT:
"I see you have the AI-PROMPTS template open. Would you like me to help you create effective prompts for your specific project? I'll ask about your project type, common challenges, and collaboration needs to build a customized prompt library.

Say 'yes' to start the interview, or 'skip' if you want to customize manually."

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. "What's your project name and repository URL?" (fills project context prompts)
2. "What are your most common technical challenges?" (creates specialized prompts)
3. "What type of code/content review do you need?" (customizes review prompts)
4. "What are your main problem-solving approaches?" (tailors diagnostic prompts)
5. "Do you have urgent/emergency scenarios that might arise?" (creates troubleshooting prompts)
6. "What communication style do you prefer?" (adjusts prompt tone)

# AI Prompts - [PROJECT NAME]

*Collection of effective AI prompts for [PROJECT TYPE] collaboration*

## Project Context Prompts

### Session Start Prompt
```
I'm working on the [PROJECT NAME] project. Please read the following context carefully:

**PROJECT**: [PROJECT NAME] - [PROJECT DESCRIPTION]
**REPOSITORY**: [YOUR REPOSITORY URL]
**CURRENT STATUS**: [CURRENT PROJECT STATUS]

**KEY CONTEXT**:
1. [Key context point 1 about your project]
2. [Key context point 2 about your project]
3. [Key context point 3 about your project]
4. [User preferences and working style]
5. [Critical requirements or constraints]

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: Check session-continuity/CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md for current project status
2. [Second priority action for your project]
3. Apply session lens approach - focus on 4-6 items maximum per session
4. [Fourth priority action for your project]

Please confirm you understand this context and are ready to collaborate effectively.
```

### Problem-Solving Prompt
```
We're working on [specific issue] in [PROJECT NAME]. Here's the context:
- Current situation: [describe current state]
- Desired outcome: [describe goal]
- Constraints: [any limitations specific to your project]
- Previous attempts: [what's been tried]

Please analyze this systematically and suggest a surgical approach based on [YOUR DOMAIN] best practices.
```

### Code Review Prompt
```
Please review this [script/code/content] for:
1. [Your specific quality criteria 1]
2. [Your specific quality criteria 2]
3. [Your specific quality criteria 3]
4. [Your specific quality criteria 4]
5. [Your specific quality criteria 5]

Maintain [YOUR PROJECT] standards and [YOUR QUALITY LEVEL] requirements.
```

## Specialized Prompts

### [YOUR DOMAIN] Troubleshooting
```
I have a [DOMAIN-SPECIFIC ISSUE] that's failing. The [item/document/code] is [characteristics]. 
Please analyze the failure pattern and suggest specific fixes using [YOUR TOOLS/METHODS]:
- [Tool/method 1] for [issue type 1]
- [Tool/method 2] for [issue type 2]
- [Tool/method 3] for [comprehensive fixes]

Focus on surgical solutions, not broad fixes.
```

### Documentation Enhancement
```
Please review this documentation for:
1. Clarity for [YOUR AUDIENCE] consumption
2. Step-by-step actionability for [YOUR USE CASE]
3. [YOUR PROJECT]-specific example inclusion
4. Professional presentation for [YOUR STANDARDS]
5. Session continuity integration

Maintain our [YOUR METHODOLOGY] approach standards.
```

### Implementation Gap Detection
```
I see the system is designed to [specific behavior]. If it were working correctly, wouldn't we see [expected evidence]? 

Let's validate whether our design matches our implementation:
- What should be happening automatically in [YOUR PROJECT]?
- What requires manual intervention?
- How can we test this recursively?

Focus on reality vs. aspiration for [YOUR DOMAIN].
```

### Timeline Reality Check
```
You suggested [timeframe] for [task]. Could we do this faster?
- What's the simplest version that works for [YOUR PROJECT]?
- Are we overcomplicating the approach for [YOUR DOMAIN]?
- Can we iterate quickly rather than plan extensively?

Challenge complexity assumptions and bias toward rapid execution in [YOUR CONTEXT].
```

### Expert Intuition Validation
```
I have a suspicion about [specific issue]. My intuition is [hypothesis].
- Can we test this specific theory first?
- Should we ignore obvious symptoms and focus on root cause?
- How do we validate with real data rather than artificial examples?

Use surgical approach based on [YOUR DOMAIN] expertise.
```

### ðŸš¨ Urgent [PROJECT TYPE] Issues
```
I'm working on [PROJECT NAME] and have an urgent issue. Please read this context:

**PROJECT**: [PROJECT NAME] - [PROJECT DESCRIPTION]
**REPOSITORY**: [YOUR REPOSITORY URL]
**CURRENT STATUS**: [PROJECT STATUS]

**ðŸš¨ URGENT CONTEXT**: [Describe your urgent situation and what's not working as planned]

**KEY CONTEXT**:
1. [Critical context about your project]
2. [Important constraints or requirements]
3. [User preferences for urgent situations]
4. [Tools and methods available]

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: Check session-continuity/CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md for current project status
2. Focus on [URGENT PRIORITY] troubleshooting
3. Apply session lens approach - focus on 4-6 items maximum per session
4. Help debug what's "not working as planned" in [YOUR SYSTEM]

**ðŸ“‹ FOR COMPLETE CONTEXT (if needed)**:
- Read `session-continuity/SESSION-ENTRANCE-PROMPT.md` - Complete entrance protocol
- Read `session-continuity/CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md` - Latest project status  
- Read `session-continuity/README-FOR-FUTURE-AI.md` - Comprehensive AI context
- Read `session-continuity/CONVERSATIONAL-INSIGHTS.md` - Collaboration preferences

Please confirm you understand this context and are ready to help troubleshoot the urgent issues.
