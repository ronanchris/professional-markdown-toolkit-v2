ü§ñ AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER
When a user opens this document, automatically offer to help customize it through an interview.

AI ASSISTANT PROMPT:
"I see you have the CURRENT-PROJECT-CONTEXT template open. Would you like me to help you customize this for your specific project through a quick interview? I'll ask you targeted questions and fill in the template based on your answers. This usually takes 5-10 minutes and gives you a ready-to-use project context document.

Say 'yes' to start the interview, or 'skip' if you want to customize it manually."

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. "What's your project name and what type of project is this?" (fills Project Identity section)
2. "What are your main goals for this project?" (fills Primary Objectives)
3. "What does success look like for you?" (fills Success Criteria) 
4. "What's most important to focus on right now?" (fills Current Priorities)
5. "What technologies/tools are you using?" (fills Tech Stack)
6. "Is there anything urgent or time-sensitive about this project?" (helps prioritize sections)

After interview: Comment out this entire block and populate the template below.
