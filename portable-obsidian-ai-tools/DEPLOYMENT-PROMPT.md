## ðŸš€ **DEPLOYMENT PROMPT** (Copy Everything Below)

```
Please help me deploy the Portable Obsidian AI Tools from GitHub into this project. Here's what I need you to do:

1. **Clone and Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ronanchris/professional-markdown-toolkit.git temp-toolkit
   cp -r temp-toolkit/portable-obsidian-ai-tools ./
   rm -rf temp-toolkit
   ```

2. **Run Installation:**
   ```bash
   cd portable-obsidian-ai-tools
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Set Up Session Continuity Templates:**
   ```bash
   cp -r portable-obsidian-ai-tools/ai-collaboration/universal-session-continuity ./session-continuity
   ```

4. **Display Cursor Rules Setup Instructions:**
   After completing the above, please:
   - Read the contents of `portable-obsidian-ai-tools/.cursorrules`
   - Tell me: "The toolkit is deployed! Now you need to copy the cursor rules. I'll show you the complete rules file content below. Please copy it and paste it into your `.cursor/rules/cursorrules.mdc` file."
   - Display the complete contents of the `.cursorrules` file for me to copy

5. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   ls -la portable-obsidian-ai-tools/
   echo "ðŸŽ¯ Available tools:"
   echo "- Notion import fixes: portable-obsidian-ai-tools/obsidian-tools/markdown-processing/"
   echo "- Metadata tools: portable-obsidian-ai-tools/obsidian-tools/metadata-tools/"
   echo "- Template management: portable-obsidian-ai-tools/obsidian-tools/template-management/"
   echo "- AI collaboration: portable-obsidian-ai-tools/ai-collaboration/"
   echo "- Quick reference: portable-obsidian-ai-tools/DEAD-SIMPLE.md"
   ```

6. **Test Template Interview System:**
   - Open `session-continuity/CURRENT-PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`
   - Offer to run the AI customization interview to set up my project context
   - Walk me through the guided setup if I say yes

Please execute all these steps and let me know when the deployment is complete and ready for the cursor rules setup.
