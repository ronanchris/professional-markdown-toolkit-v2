ü§ñ AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER
When a user opens this document, automatically offer to help customize it through an interview.

AI ASSISTANT PROMPT:
"I see you have the Urgent Troubleshooting Template open. Would you like me to help you customize this for your specific urgent situation? I'll ask about your project context, the urgent issue, and what kind of immediate help you need.

Say 'yes' to start the urgent customization interview, or 'skip' if you want to handle it manually."

URGENT CUSTOMIZATION QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. "What's the urgent situation you're facing?" (fills URGENT CONTEXT)
2. "What's your project name and current status?" (fills PROJECT section)
3. "What specific system or component is not working as planned?" (fills SPECIFIC SYSTEM)
4. "What are your immediate priorities for fixing this?" (fills IMMEDIATE ACTIONS)
5. "Are there any critical prerequisites or setup requirements?" (fills CRITICAL PREREQUISITE)

After interview: Comment out this entire block and populate the urgent troubleshooting prompt below.

# Urgent Troubleshooting Template

## üö® **Template Usage**
Use this template when dealing with urgent issues that require immediate AI assistance with full project context.

## üìã **Customizable Urgent Troubleshooting Prompt**

```
I'm working on [PROJECT NAME]. Please read the following context carefully:

**PROJECT**: [PROJECT NAME] - [PROJECT DESCRIPTION]
**REPOSITORY**: [YOUR REPOSITORY URL]
**CURRENT STATUS**: [PROJECT STATUS]

**üö® URGENT CONTEXT**: [DESCRIBE URGENT SITUATION AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING]

**KEY CONTEXT**:
1. [KEY PROJECT CONSTRAINT OR REQUIREMENT 1]
2. [KEY PROJECT CONSTRAINT OR REQUIREMENT 2]
3. [KEY PROJECT CONSTRAINT OR REQUIREMENT 3]
4. [USER COLLABORATION PREFERENCES]
5. [CRITICAL SAFETY OR BACKUP REQUIREMENTS]
6. **CRITICAL**: [SESSION MANAGEMENT OR FOCUS REQUIREMENTS]

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: [PRIMARY DIAGNOSTIC OR CONTEXT ACTION]
2. Focus on [SPECIFIC URGENT PRIORITY] troubleshooting
3. [SCOPE OR METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS]
4. Help debug what's "not working as planned" in [SPECIFIC SYSTEM/COMPONENT]

**üìã FOR COMPLETE CONTEXT (if needed)**:
- Read `[CONTEXT DOCUMENT 1]` - [PURPOSE]
- Read `[CONTEXT DOCUMENT 2]` - [PURPOSE]
- Read `[CONTEXT DOCUMENT 3]` - [PURPOSE]
- Read `[CONTEXT DOCUMENT 4]` - [PURPOSE]

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**: [ANY SPECIFIC SETUP REQUIREMENTS FOR THE URGENT ISSUE]

Please confirm you understand this context and are ready to help troubleshoot the urgent issues.
```

## üîß **Domain-Specific Urgent Scenario Examples**

**For Technical Deployment Issues:**
```
**üö® URGENT CONTEXT**: Deployed [SYSTEM NAME] to [ENVIRONMENT] but [SPECIFIC FAILURE]. [IMPACT AND TIMELINE PRESSURE].

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: Check [LOG FILES/ERROR SOURCES] for diagnostic information
2. Focus on [DEPLOYMENT COMPONENT] troubleshooting
3. Apply surgical debugging approach - isolate failure point
4. Help debug what's "not working as planned" in [DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM]

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**: Access to [DEPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT] and [REQUIRED CREDENTIALS/TOOLS]
```

**For Data Import/Processing Failures:**
```
**üö® URGENT CONTEXT**: [DATA IMPORT/PROCESSING TOOL] failing with [DATA CHARACTERISTICS]. [SPECIFIC ERROR OR FAILURE PATTERN].

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: Analyze [ERROR LOGS/FAILURE PATTERNS] for root cause
2. Focus on [DATA PROCESSING COMPONENT] troubleshooting  
3. Use systematic approach - test with smaller data samples
4. Help debug what's "not working as planned" in [DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM]

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**: Access to [SAMPLE DATA] and [PROCESSING TOOLS]
```

**For Session Management/Automation Failures:**
```
**üö® URGENT CONTEXT**: [AUTOMATION SYSTEM] not triggering as designed. [EXPECTED BEHAVIOR] vs [ACTUAL BEHAVIOR].

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: Validate [AUTOMATION RULES/CONFIGURATION] against current setup
2. Focus on [AUTOMATION COMPONENT] troubleshooting
3. Test automation triggers with known working scenarios
4. Help debug what's "not working as planned" in [AUTOMATION SYSTEM]

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**: [AUTOMATION CONFIGURATION FILES] properly installed and [TRIGGER CONDITIONS] met
```

## üìä **Urgent Troubleshooting Success Indicators**

Effective urgent troubleshooting when:
- ‚úÖ AI immediately grasps the urgency level and time constraints
- ‚úÖ AI focuses on surgical approach rather than broad system fixes
- ‚úÖ AI uses available diagnostic information systematically
- ‚úÖ AI provides actionable solutions within realistic scope
- ‚úÖ Real problem is resolved, not just symptoms masked
- ‚úÖ Solution can be validated quickly with available tools/data

## üéØ **After Resolution Follow-Up**

Once urgent issue is resolved:
1. ‚úÖ **Document the root cause** for future prevention
2. ‚úÖ **Update relevant templates** if this reveals common pattern
3. ‚úÖ **Test the fix** with multiple scenarios to ensure stability
4. ‚úÖ **Share solution** if it could help others with similar issues
