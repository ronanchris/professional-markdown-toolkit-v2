ü§ñ AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER
When a user opens this document, automatically offer to help customize it through an interview.

AI ASSISTANT PROMPT:
"I see you have the SESSION-ENTRANCE-PROMPT template open. This creates a copy-paste prompt that gives any AI assistant complete context about your project and how to collaborate effectively. Would you like me to help you customize this for your specific project through a quick interview?

Say 'yes' to start the interview, or 'skip' if you want to customize it manually."

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. What's your project name and main purpose?
2. What's the current status? (Planning/Development/Testing/Production)
3. Which tools are you primarily using? (This helps customize the collaboration guidance)
4. What's your collaboration style preference? (Direct feedback, rapid iteration, etc.)
5. Any specific context that new AI assistants should know about your work?

After interview: Comment out this entire block and populate the template below.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Save your customized version as:
- `session-continuity/05-SESSION-ENTRANCE-PROMPT.md` (remove -TEMPLATE from filename)
- Keep this template file unchanged for future use

# Session Entrance Prompt for [PROJECT NAME]

**PURPOSE**: This document provides the complete context needed for any AI assistant to effectively collaborate on this project from the first message.

## üìÅ **File Placement Instructions**

**After customization:**
1. **Save as**: `session-continuity/05-SESSION-ENTRANCE-PROMPT.md` (remove `-TEMPLATE` from filename)
2. **Keep template**: Leave this template file unchanged for future projects
3. **Location**: Place in your project's `session-continuity/` folder alongside other session documents

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**

**Before using this prompt, you MUST have the session continuity system installed:**

1. **Copy the session continuity templates** from `session-continuity/` 
2. **Set up your project-specific versions** using the AI interview systems
3. **Optional: Install cursor rules** for automatic session management triggers

**Without session continuity setup:** You'll get project context but **no automatic session management** (auto-triggers, progress tracking, completion detection, etc.)
