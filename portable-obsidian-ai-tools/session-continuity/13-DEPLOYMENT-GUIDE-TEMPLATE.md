ü§ñ AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER
When a user opens this document, automatically offer to help customize it through an interview.

AI ASSISTANT PROMPT:
"I see you have the DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE template open. This creates a systematic approach for deploying your [PROJECT TYPE] with proper testing, backup, and verification procedures. Would you like me to help you customize this for your specific project and tools through a quick interview?

Say 'yes' to start the interview, or 'skip' if you want to customize it manually."

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. What type of deployment is this? (copying tools to new project, sharing with team, distributing toolkit, etc.)
2. What are your critical tools and files that must be included?
3. What safety and backup requirements do you have?
4. Who will be using this deployment? (just you, team members, public users)
5. Any specific testing or verification steps that are essential for your tools?
