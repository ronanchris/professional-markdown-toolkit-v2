**User Experience Level**: [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced with these tools]
**Session Continuity**: [Enabled/Basic/Disabled - affects AI behavior]

## ü§ù **Communication Preferences**

### **User Communication Style**
- **Feedback Style**: [Direct and honest / Diplomatic / Encouraging]
- **Pace Preference**: [Rapid iteration / Careful planning / Mixed approach]
- **Detail Level**: [High detail explanations / Brief and focused / Contextual]
- **Challenge Level**: [Challenge assumptions / Supportive guidance / Follow lead]

### **AI Response Guidelines**
- **Tool Recommendations**: [Always suggest specific tools / Ask what to use / User will specify]
- **Error Handling**: [Explain errors fully / Provide quick fixes / Ask user preference]
- **Progress Tracking**: [Automatic updates / Manual prompts / User-driven only]
- **Documentation**: [Update templates automatically / Ask before updating / User maintains]

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tool Usage Guidelines**

### **Notion Import Tools**
**When to Recommend:**
- User mentions import problems, Unicode issues, or WikiLink errors
- Files won't import into Notion or other platforms
- Complex formatting causing issues

**AI Behavior:**
- **Always start with**: `notion_complete_fixer.py` for comprehensive fixes
- **For specific issues**: Recommend targeted tools (unicode_cleaner.py, wikilink_converter.py)
- **Testing approach**: [Always use --dry-run first / User preference / Skip dry-run for experienced users]
- **Backup reminder**: [Always remind about backups / Assume user knows / Check if backup system working]

### **Metadata Management Tools**
**When to Recommend:**
- YAML frontmatter issues or inconsistencies
- Template integration problems
- Batch metadata operations needed

**AI Behavior:**
- **Safety first**: Always recommend `safe_metadata_removal.py --dry-run` before batch operations
- **Scope checking**: Ask about target files/folders before running batch operations
- **Integration awareness**: Consider impact on templates and existing workflows
- **Progress tracking**: [Update session plan automatically / Ask user / Track manually]

### **Template Management Tools**
**When to Recommend:**
- Template application or fixes needed
- Standardizing document structure
- Obsidian template integration

**AI Behavior:**
- **Template preservation**: Always check if user wants to preserve existing content
- **Batch vs individual**: Ask about scope for multiple files
- **Testing strategy**: [Test on single file first / User experienced with tools / Full batch okay]

### **Markdown Processing Tools**
**When to Recommend:**
- Formatting inconsistencies
- Batch cleanup needed  
- Professional formatting required

**AI Behavior:**
- **Scope awareness**: Ask about recursive processing for directories
- **Quality standards**: [Always use --verbose for feedback / User prefers quiet / Ask preference]
- **Verification**: [Always check results / User will verify / Trust tool output]

## üìã **Session Continuity Behavior**

### **Session Start Protocol**
```
IF session-continuity enabled:
1. Check for existing 02-SESSION-PLAN.md
2. If no plan: Offer to create via interview
3. If plan exists: Load current focus (4-6 items max)
4. Summarize current status and ask how to proceed

IF session-continuity disabled:
1. Simple greeting and readiness check
2. Ask about current goals
3. Proceed with tool usage as needed
```

### **Progress Tracking**
- **Auto-completion detection**: [Enabled - monitor for "That's complete" / Disabled / Ask user preference]
- **Plan updates**: [Automatic when major progress / Manual prompts / User-driven only]
- **Deviation tracking**: [Auto-detect approach changes / Simple logging / User decides]

### **Session End Protocol**  
- **Progress summary**: [Automatic session wrap-up / Ask if user wants summary / Skip unless requested]
- **Next session preparation**: [Update current state automatically / Brief notes only / User handles]

## üîß **Tool Integration Patterns**

### **Typical Workflow Patterns**
**Notion Import Project:**
```
1. Start with session plan (if enabled)
2. Identify problematic files
3. Run notion_complete_fixer.py with --dry-run
4. Process files and verify results
5. Update progress (manual or automatic)
```

**Metadata Standardization:**
```
1. Plan scope and backup strategy
2. Use safe_metadata_removal.py --dry-run to understand scope
3. Apply fix_metadata.sh for standard fixes
4. Verify results and document patterns
5. Track completion
```

**Template Application:**
```
1. Identify target files and template needs
2. Test apply_template.sh on single file first
3. Batch process if successful
4. Verify template integration
5. Document results
```

## üö® **Safety & Error Handling**

### **Critical Safety Rules**
- **NEVER skip backups** unless user explicitly requests --no-backup
- **ALWAYS use --dry-run** for first-time tool usage (unless user experienced)
- **VERIFY file paths** are relative and correct before batch operations
- **CHECK dependencies** if tools fail (requirements.txt current?)

### **Error Response Protocol**
1. **Immediate safety check**: Is user data at risk?
2. **Error explanation**: Clear description of what went wrong  
3. **Recovery options**: How to fix or restore from backup
4. **Prevention**: How to avoid this error in future

### **User Experience Standards**
- **Tool recommendations**: Include brief explanation of what tool does
- **Command examples**: Always show actual command with options
- **Success verification**: Explain how user can confirm tool worked correctly
- **Next steps**: Clear guidance on what to do after tool completes

## üìä **Quality Standards**

### **Tool Usage Quality**
- **Appropriate tool selection**: Right tool for the specific problem
- **Proper command options**: Use correct flags and parameters
- **Safety measures**: Backups and dry-runs when appropriate
- **Result verification**: Help user confirm tools worked correctly

### **Communication Quality**
- **Clear explanations**: User understands what tools do and why
- **Honest feedback**: Acknowledge when approaches don't work
- **Progress awareness**: User knows current status and next steps
- **Learning capture**: [Document insights for future sessions / Basic notes / User preference]

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

### **Technical Success**
- Tools work reliably for user's specific needs
- No data loss or corruption incidents
- Efficient tool usage with minimal repetition
- User feels confident using tools independently

### **Collaboration Success**

- Confirm understanding before proceeding
- Document learning for future reference

### **For Complex Projects:**
- Enable full session continuity features
- Track tool usage patterns and effectiveness
- Document workflow optimizations discovered
- Plan tool integration strategies

### **For Simple Tasks:**
- Disable session continuity overhead
- Focus on immediate tool usage
- Minimal documentation and tracking
