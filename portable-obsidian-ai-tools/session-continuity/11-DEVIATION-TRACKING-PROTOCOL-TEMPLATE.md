ü§ñ AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER
When a user opens this document, automatically offer to help customize it through an interview.

AI ASSISTANT PROMPT:
"I see you have the DEVIATION-TRACKING-PROTOCOL template open. This captures when and why your project approaches change from the original plan, turning deviations into learning opportunities. Would you like me to help you set this up through a quick interview?

Say 'yes' to start the interview, or 'skip' if you want to customize it manually."

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. How do you typically handle it when plans change or approaches need to shift?
2. Do you prefer to document changes as they happen, or review them periodically?
3. What kinds of deviations do you want to track? (timeline changes, scope shifts, tool changes, etc.)
4. How do you usually learn from things that don't go as planned?
5. Any recent project changes you'd like to document as an example?

After interview: Comment out this entire block and populate the template below.

# Deviation Tracking Protocol

**Core Principle**: Every deviation from the plan is a learning opportunity that should be captured and analyzed for [PROJECT NAME].

## üéØ **Why This Matters**

**Your Project Context**: [Why tracking deviations is important for your specific work]

The gap between plan and reality contains valuable learning:
- Why did we underestimate/overestimate [YOUR TYPICAL ESTIMATION CHALLENGES]?
- What assumptions were wrong about [YOUR DOMAIN/TOOLS]?
- What emerged that we didn't anticipate with [YOUR SPECIFIC CONTEXT]?
- How should we plan differently for [YOUR TYPE OF WORK] next time?

## üö® **Deviation Triggers**

### **When to Document a Deviation**
**In [YOUR PROJECT CONTEXT]:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Timeline Changed**: [YOUR TIMELINE PATTERNS - e.g., estimated vs. actual time for tool usage]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Scope Shifted**: [YOUR SCOPE PATTERNS - e.g., added/removed files, changed requirements]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Approach Changed**: [YOUR APPROACH PATTERNS - e.g., switched tools, changed methodology]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Priorities Reordered**: [YOUR PRIORITY PATTERNS - e.g., urgent issues emerged]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **New Requirements Emerged**: [YOUR DISCOVERY PATTERNS - e.g., discovered missing needs]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Assumptions Proven Wrong**: [YOUR ASSUMPTION PATTERNS - e.g., reality didn't match expectations]

### **Your Project's Deviation History**

| Original Plan | What Actually Happened | Why We Deviated | Learning |
|---------------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| [Planned approach 1] | [What actually happened] | [Reason for change] | [What this teaches for future] |
| [Planned approach 2] | [Actual outcome] | [Deviation trigger] | [Learning captured] |
| [Planned approach 3] | [Real result] | [Why we changed] | [Insight gained] |

## üìù **Deviation Documentation Template**

### **Quick Capture Format**
```
DEVIATION: [Brief description]
ORIGINAL: [What we planned]
ACTUAL: [What we did instead]
TRIGGER: [What caused the change]
IMPACT: [Time/scope/quality effects]
LEARNING: [What this teaches us for next time]
```

### **Example from [YOUR PROJECT TYPE]**
```
DEVIATION: [YOUR EXAMPLE - e.g., "Switched from individual file processing to batch processing"]
ORIGINAL: [ORIGINAL PLAN - e.g., "Process files one at a time for safety"]
ACTUAL: [WHAT HAPPENED - e.g., "Used batch processing tools for efficiency"]
TRIGGER: [WHAT CAUSED CHANGE - e.g., "Realized volume was much larger than expected"]
IMPACT: [EFFECTS - e.g., "Saved 3 hours, but required more careful backup strategy"]
LEARNING: [INSIGHT - e.g., "Always assess scope before choosing individual vs batch approaches"]
```

## üîÑ **Plan Update Triggers**

### **Automatic Update Situations for [YOUR WORK]**
- Any deviation that affects [YOUR KEY CONSTRAINT 1 - e.g., multiple files/tools]

2. **Assess impact** on remaining work with [YOUR TOOLS]
3. **Update relevant plans** ([YOUR PLANNING DOCUMENTS])
4. **Capture lessons** for future similar projects
5. **Communicate changes** if working with [YOUR TEAM/STAKEHOLDERS]

## üß† **Learning Extraction**

### **Pattern Recognition Questions for [YOUR DOMAIN]**
- Is this deviation type recurring in [YOUR TYPE OF WORK]? 
- What early signals could have predicted this change in [YOUR CONTEXT]?
- How can we build flexibility for this type of change with [YOUR TOOLS]?
- What assumptions should we test earlier when using [YOUR APPROACH]?

### **Meta-Learning from [YOUR PROJECT]**
**Common Patterns in [YOUR WORK]**:
- **Timeline Pattern**: [YOUR PATTERN - e.g., "Always takes longer than expected to test new tools"]
- **Scope Pattern**: [YOUR PATTERN - e.g., "File problems are usually more complex than they initially appear"]
- **Quality Pattern**: [YOUR PATTERN - e.g., "User prefers thorough solutions over quick fixes"]
- **Tool Pattern**: [YOUR PATTERN - e.g., "Backup and verification always takes extra time"]

**Rule for [YOUR PROJECT]**: If we deviate from the plan without documenting it, we've missed a learning opportunity. Every deviation is data about how to work better with [YOUR TOOLS] and improve [YOUR PROCESS].

**Instructions for Use**: Customize all bracketed placeholders for your specific project, tools, and work context. Focus on the types of deviations that actually occur in your work. Update patterns regularly as your project evolves and you learn more about effective planning and execution.
