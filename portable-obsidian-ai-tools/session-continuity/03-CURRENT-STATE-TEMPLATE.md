ü§ñ AI CUSTOMIZATION TRIGGER
When a user opens this document, automatically offer to help customize it through an interview.

AI ASSISTANT PROMPT:
"I see you have the CURRENT-STATE template open. Would you like me to help you set up project status tracking through a quick interview? I'll ask you about your current project state, what tools you've been using, and what progress you've made. This creates a snapshot for session continuity.

Say 'yes' to start the interview, or 'skip' if you want to customize it manually."

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS TO ASK:
1. What is your current project status? (Planning/Development/Testing/Production)
2. Which Obsidian tools have you been using? (Notion import, metadata, templates, markdown processing)
3. What are your most recent accomplishments?
4. What's currently in progress?
5. What's blocked or waiting?
6. What are your immediate next actions?

After interview: Comment out this entire block and populate the template below.

## üìã **Template Usage Notes**

### **For Tool-Heavy Projects:**
Focus the "Tool Usage Summary" section on the tools you're actively using. Remove or minimize sections for tools you're not using to keep the document focused.

### **For Simple Projects:**
You can simplify this template by focusing on just:
- Immediate Next Actions
- Progress Summary (basic)
- Recent Achievements
- Session Continuity Notes

### **For Complex Multi-Tool Projects:**
Use all sections and update regularly. The comprehensive tracking helps identify patterns and optimize tool usage across long projects.

### **Session Continuity Integration:**
- **Update after major milestones** or when switching between tools
- **Brief daily updates** on progress and immediate next actions
- **Weekly comprehensive updates** including all tool usage and health indicators
- **End-of-phase complete updates** when major work phases complete
