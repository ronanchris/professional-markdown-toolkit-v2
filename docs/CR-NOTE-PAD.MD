THINGS TO REMEMBER TO ADD TO AGENT:

# item 5

I need to find the diagram that you made for me about how this system works. I think it was a mermaid diagram.

# item 6

Do we have parity between the cursor rules document that is in our portable Obsidian AI tools and the actual cursorrules.mdc document?

# item 8

Once we find that mermaid diagram that outlines our process, I think we should revisit and make sure that our core files are set up to honor this process. Furthermore, I'm starting to think that we have so many files in our session continuity package that I'm wondering if we should actually rename them based on a numbering system, like each one gets a prefix of 01- then 02-. And for example, if there's a certain order, because I would like to talk further about how the AI actually uses those and how we can make sure that the order is followed by both me, the human and you, the AI.

# item 15

If we opt not to use saved memories, is there a way to detect memories and then have them saved locally instead of in the global system?



# item 17

let's setup a .cursorindexingignore

# item 18

Here might be nice to also offer our structure and how we're using session continuity.
