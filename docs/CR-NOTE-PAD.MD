THINGS TO REMEMBER TO ADD TO AGENT:

# item 1

I'm working on the Professional Markdown Toolkit project. Please read the following context carefully:

**PROJECT**: Professional Markdown Toolkit - Production-ready Obsidian vault management and markdown processing tools
**REPOSITORY**: https://github.com/ronanchris/profession-markdown-toolkit.git
**CURRENT STATUS**: Production ready + Notion import tools + Portable distribution + **Plan-Driven Session Management System**

**üö® URGENT CONTEXT**: I've deployed the portable toolkit to a family health project (Parkinson's documentation, power of attorney needs) but some components are "not working as planned." Need troubleshooting and fixes.

**KEY CONTEXT**:
1. This is enterprise-grade toolkit with comprehensive backup systems and safety features
2. We have two distributions: main repository + portable toolkit (100% feature parity required)
3. **NEW**: Complete plan-driven session management system with automatic triggers and documentation
4. User prefers rapid iteration, challenges assumptions, and values honest feedback over politeness
5. All scripts include backup functionality - NEVER disable without explicit user request
6. **CRITICAL**: Always check for session-continuity/SESSION-PLAN.md and follow session lens approach (4-6 items focus)

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: Check session-continuity/CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md for current project status
2. Focus on deployment troubleshooting for urgent family health project
3. Apply session lens approach - focus on 4-6 items maximum per session
4. Help debug what's "not working as planned" in the portable toolkit deployment

**üìã FOR COMPLETE CONTEXT (if needed)**:
- Read `session-continuity/SESSION-ENTRANCE-PROMPT.md` - Complete entrance protocol
- Read `session-continuity/CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md` - Latest project status  
- Read `session-continuity/README-FOR-FUTURE-AI.md` - Comprehensive AI context
- Read `session-continuity/CONVERSATIONAL-INSIGHTS.md` - Collaboration preferences

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**: For session continuity system to work automatically, cursor rules should be installed from `portable-obsidian-ai-tools/.cursorrules` in the family health project.

Please confirm you understand this context and are ready to help troubleshoot the deployment issues.

# item 2

I noticed that with the updated cursor, there are pop-ups that are asking me about things to remember, and when I say accept, that's great, but are those things isolated to only this project, or are they something that are useful to other projects, and if so, how can I get access to those rules that I think you're asking me to remember?

# item 3

Also, based on the updates that you've made, I've noticed that in my other project I'm having issues with that project getting the timestamps correctly. It's always doing them wrong. So, have in the portable documents folder, have you made a provision for this to make sure that I'm able to get that benefit when I use this toolkit in other projects?

# item 4

Also, with respect to the opening prompts, what I prefer is that our prompts are set up so that they are time stamped and marked with the session ID so that I can have a historical view with the most recent one on the top and the oldest one on the bottom. Do you recommend that we do that in one file or do you recommend that our session continuity prompts be in a folder where we add a time and date stamp to the name of the markdown documents containing each prompt?
