THINGS TO REMEMBER TO ADD TO AGENT:

# item 5

I need to find the diagram that you made for me about how this system works. I think it was a mermaid diagram.

# item 6

Do we have parity between the cursor rules document that is in our portable Obsidian AI tools and the actual cursorrules.mdc document?

# item 7

Please review this prompt that you made for me earlier in the conversation that we're going to use to start and update this, or should I be using the prompt that you've already created for me in our local project session continuity.

I'm working on the Professional Markdown Toolkit project. Please read the following context carefully:

**PROJECT**: Professional Markdown Toolkit - Production-ready Obsidian vault management and markdown processing tools
**REPOSITORY**: https://github.com/ronanchris/profession-markdown-toolkit.git
**CURRENT STATUS**: Production ready + Notion import tools + Portable distribution + **Plan-Driven Session Management System**

**üö® URGENT CONTEXT**: I've deployed the portable toolkit to a family health project (Parkinson's documentation, power of attorney needs) but some components are "not working as planned." Need troubleshooting and fixes.

**KEY CONTEXT**:
1. This is enterprise-grade toolkit with comprehensive backup systems and safety features
2. We have two distributions: main repository + portable toolkit (100% feature parity required)
3. **NEW**: Complete plan-driven session management system with automatic triggers and documentation
4. User prefers rapid iteration, challenges assumptions, and values honest feedback over politeness
5. All scripts include backup functionality - NEVER disable without explicit user request
6. **CRITICAL**: Always check for session-continuity/SESSION-PLAN.md and follow session lens approach (4-6 items focus)

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: Check session-continuity/CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md for current project status
2. Focus on deployment troubleshooting for urgent family health project
3. Apply session lens approach - focus on 4-6 items maximum per session
4. Help debug what's "not working as planned" in the portable toolkit deployment

**üìã FOR COMPLETE CONTEXT (if needed)**:
- Read `session-continuity/SESSION-ENTRANCE-PROMPT.md` - Complete entrance protocol
- Read `session-continuity/CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md` - Latest project status  
- Read `session-continuity/README-FOR-FUTURE-AI.md` - Comprehensive AI context
- Read `session-continuity/CONVERSATIONAL-INSIGHTS.md` - Collaboration preferences

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**: For session continuity system to work automatically, cursor rules should be installed from `portable-obsidian-ai-tools/.cursorrules` in the family health project.

Please confirm you understand this context and are ready to help troubleshoot the deployment issues.


# item 8

Once we find that mermaid diagram that outlines our process, I think we should revisit and make sure that our core files are set up to honor this process. Furthermore, I'm starting to think that we have so many files in our session continuity package that I'm wondering if we should actually rename them based on a numbering system, like each one gets a prefix of 01- then 02-. And for example, if there's a certain order, because I would like to talk further about how the AI actually uses those and how we can make sure that the order is followed by both me, the human and you, the AI.



# item 12

Let's go ahead and split my cursor rules.mdc file into the multiple files that we recommended during our research.



# item 15

If we opt not to use saved memories, is there a way to detect memories and then have them saved locally instead of in the global system?



# item 17

let's setup a .cursorindexingignore

# item 18

Here might be nice to also offer our structure and how we're using session continuity.
