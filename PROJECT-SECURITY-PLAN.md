## üîß IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### **Standard Patterns to Implement**:

**Shell Script Header**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # Exit on error
set -u  # Exit on undefined variable

# Get script directory for relative paths
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
```

**Python Dependency Check**:
```python
def check_dependencies():
    """Check required dependencies are available."""
    missing = []
    try:
        import yaml
    except ImportError:
        missing.append("PyYAML (pip install pyyaml)")
    
    if missing:
        print("Missing required dependencies:")
        for dep in missing:
            print(f"  - {dep}")
        sys.exit(1)
```

**Backup Function**:
```bash
create_backup() {
    local file="$1"
    local backup_dir="${SCRIPT_DIR}/../backups/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
    mkdir -p "$backup_dir"
    cp "$file" "$backup_dir/"
    echo "Backup created: $backup_dir/$(basename "$file")"
}
```
