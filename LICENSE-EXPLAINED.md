## 🎉 What You CAN Do (No Permission Needed)

### **Personal Use**
- ✅ Download and use all scripts for personal projects
- ✅ Modify scripts to fit your specific needs
- ✅ Run scripts on your documents, websites, or projects

### **Commercial Use**

- ✅ Offer services using these scripts
- ✅ Modify and integrate into proprietary software

### **Distribution & Sharing**
- ✅ Share the scripts with colleagues, friends, or online
- ✅ Fork the repository and create your own version
- ✅ Redistribute modified versions
- ✅ Include in software packages or distributions

### **Modification**
- ✅ Change any part of the code to suit your needs

## 📋 What You MUST Do (Legal Requirements)

### **Include the License**
When you distribute or share the scripts:
- 📄 Include the `LICENSE` file or its contents
- 📄 Keep the copyright notice intact
- 📄 That's it! Very simple requirements

### **Example of Proper Attribution:**
If you include these scripts in your project, just add something like:
```
