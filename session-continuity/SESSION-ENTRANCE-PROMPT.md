# Session Entrance Prompt for Professional Markdown Toolkit

**PURPOSE**: This document provides the complete context needed for any AI assistant to effectively collaborate on this project from the first message.

## üéØ **COPY-PASTE ENTRANCE PROMPT**

```
I'm working on the Professional Markdown Toolkit project. Please read the following context carefully:

**PROJECT**: Professional Markdown Toolkit - Production-ready Obsidian vault management and markdown processing tools
**REPOSITORY**: https://github.com/ronanchris/profession-markdown-toolkit.git
**CURRENT STATUS**: Production ready + Notion import tools + Portable distribution + **Plan-Driven Session Management System**

**KEY CONTEXT**:
1. This is enterprise-grade toolkit with comprehensive backup systems and safety features
2. We have two distributions: main repository + portable toolkit (100% feature parity required)
3. **NEW**: Complete plan-driven session management system with automatic triggers and documentation
4. User prefers rapid iteration, challenges assumptions, and values honest feedback over politeness
5. All scripts include backup functionality - NEVER disable without explicit user request
6. **CRITICAL**: Always check for session-continuity/SESSION-PLAN.md and follow session lens approach (4-6 items focus)

**RECENT MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Plan-driven session management system with implementation gap detection, session lens optimization (67% efficiency gain), and recursive self-improvement capability.

**WORKING PRINCIPLES**:
- Question timeline assumptions ("could we do this faster?")
- Challenge approaches when you see better alternatives  
- Focus on working examples over theoretical explanations
- Maintain 100% redundancy between main repo and portable toolkit
- Update session continuity docs when making significant changes
- Preserve YAML frontmatter, Obsidian embeds ([[links]]), and block references (^block-id)

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: Check for session-continuity/SESSION-PLAN.md (if no plan exists, offer to create via interview)
2. Read session-continuity/CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md for current project status
3. Read session-continuity/CONVERSATIONAL-INSIGHTS.md for collaboration preferences
4. Apply session lens approach - focus on 4-6 items maximum per session
5. Monitor for trigger phrases: completion, deviation, implementation gaps

**USER PREFERENCES**:
- Direct, honest communication over diplomatic language
- Rapid iteration and execution over extensive planning
- Real-world validation over theoretical solutions
- System-thinking and reusability mindset
- Meta-conversation about improving the collaboration itself

Please confirm you understand this context and are ready to collaborate effectively.

### **Recent Work Pattern**
1. **User questions system completeness** ("If system were working, wouldn't X happen?")
2. **Implementation gap detection** (design vs. reality differences)
3. **Recursive system improvement** (use system to improve system)
4. **Computational efficiency analysis** (payload tax vs. benefits)

## üí° **Conversation Starters for New Sessions**

### **Plan-Driven Session Start**
"I've checked session-continuity/SESSION-PLAN.md and see we're in [current phase]. The session lens shows [4-6 current focus items]. What would you like to work on from the current focus, or do we need to adjust the plan?"

### **No Plan Detected**
"I don't see a SESSION-PLAN.md file. Would you like me to create one through a brief interview about your goals and timeline? This will help us stay organized and efficient."

### **Implementation Gap Check**
"I see the system is designed to [behavior]. If it were working correctly, wouldn't we see [expected evidence]? Should we validate the implementation?"

### **Session Lens Optimization**
"The current plan has [total items] items. For optimal efficiency, should we focus on 4-6 items this session? Which are the highest priority?"

## üéØ **Automatic Trigger Phrases to Monitor**

### **Completion Detection**
- "That's complete" ‚Üí Auto-check related SESSION-PLAN.md items
- "We've finished X" ‚Üí Mark X complete in session lens
- "Done with Y" ‚Üí Update Y status in plan
- "Successfully implemented" ‚Üí Check off implementation items

### **Deviation Detection**
- "Actually, let's..." ‚Üí Document deviation with date validation
- "Change of plan..." ‚Üí Update SESSION-PLAN.md deviations section
- "Better approach..." ‚Üí Cascade update to tracking documents

### **Implementation Gap Detection**
- "If the system were working, wouldn't X happen?" ‚Üí Validate implementation
- "Did you just do X because I asked, or is that automatic?" ‚Üí Check automation
- "I don't see Y having been updated" ‚Üí Identify missing automation

### **Session End Indicators**
- "Let's wrap up" ‚Üí Auto-archive SESSION-PLAN.md to archive folder
- "Session complete" ‚Üí Update CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md with progress
