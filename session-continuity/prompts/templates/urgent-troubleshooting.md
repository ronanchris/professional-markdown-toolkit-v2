# Urgent Troubleshooting Template

## üö® **Template Usage**
Use this template when dealing with urgent issues that require immediate AI assistance with full project context.

## üìã **Customizable Prompt Template**

```
I'm working on the Professional Markdown Toolkit project. Please read the following context carefully:

**PROJECT**: Professional Markdown Toolkit - Production-ready Obsidian vault management and markdown processing tools
**REPOSITORY**: https://github.com/ronanchris/profession-markdown-toolkit.git
**CURRENT STATUS**: [UPDATE WITH CURRENT PROJECT STATUS]

**üö® URGENT CONTEXT**: [DESCRIBE URGENT SITUATION AND WHAT'S NOT WORKING]

**KEY CONTEXT**:
1. This is enterprise-grade toolkit with comprehensive backup systems and safety features
2. We have two distributions: main repository + portable toolkit (100% feature parity required)
3. Complete plan-driven session management system with automatic triggers and documentation
4. User prefers rapid iteration, challenges assumptions, and values honest feedback over politeness
5. All scripts include backup functionality - NEVER disable without explicit user request
6. **CRITICAL**: Always check for session-continuity/SESSION-PLAN.md and follow session lens approach (4-6 items focus)

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
1. **FIRST**: Check session-continuity/CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md for current project status
2. Focus on [SPECIFIC URGENT PRIORITY] troubleshooting
3. Apply session lens approach - focus on 4-6 items maximum per session
4. Help debug what's "not working as planned" in [SPECIFIC SYSTEM/COMPONENT]

**üìã FOR COMPLETE CONTEXT (if needed)**:
- Read `session-continuity/SESSION-ENTRANCE-PROMPT.md` - Complete entrance protocol
- Read `session-continuity/CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md` - Latest project status  
- Read `session-continuity/README-FOR-FUTURE-AI.md` - Comprehensive AI context
- Read `session-continuity/CONVERSATIONAL-INSIGHTS.md` - Collaboration preferences

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PREREQUISITE**: [ANY SPECIFIC SETUP REQUIREMENTS FOR THE URGENT ISSUE]

Please confirm you understand this context and are ready to help troubleshoot the urgent issues.
```

## üîß **Customization Instructions**

**Required Updates:**
1. **[UPDATE WITH CURRENT PROJECT STATUS]** - Check CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md
2. **[DESCRIBE URGENT SITUATION]** - Specific urgent problem details
3. **[SPECIFIC URGENT PRIORITY]** - What needs immediate attention
4. **[SPECIFIC SYSTEM/COMPONENT]** - Which part of toolkit has issues
5. **[ANY SPECIFIC SETUP REQUIREMENTS]** - Prerequisites or context for the urgent issue

**Common Urgent Scenarios:**
- **Deployment Issues**: Use when portable toolkit deployment fails
- **Import Failures**: Use when Notion import tools aren't working
- **Session Management Bugs**: Use when session continuity system breaks
- **Script Errors**: Use when core scripts fail with real user data
