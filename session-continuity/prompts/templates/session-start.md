# Session Start Template

## ðŸŽ¯ **Template Usage**
Use this template at the beginning of new AI collaboration sessions to establish full project context and working relationship.

## ðŸ“‹ **Standard Session Start Prompt**

```
I'm working on the Professional Markdown Toolkit project. Please read the following context carefully:

**PROJECT**: Professional Markdown Toolkit - Production-ready Obsidian vault management and markdown processing tools
**REPOSITORY**: https://github.com/ronanchris/profession-markdown-toolkit.git
**CURRENT STATUS**: Production ready + Notion import tools + Portable distribution + **Plan-Driven Session Management System**

**KEY CONTEXT**:
1. This is enterprise-grade toolkit with comprehensive backup systems and safety features
2. We have two distributions: main repository + portable toolkit (100% feature parity required)
3. **NEW**: Complete plan-driven session management system with automatic triggers and documentation
4. User prefers rapid iteration, challenges assumptions, and values honest feedback over politeness
5. All scripts include backup functionality - NEVER disable without explicit user request
6. **CRITICAL**: Always load the four essential context documents (01-04) and follow session lens approach (4-6 items focus)

**RECENT MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT**: Plan-driven session management system with implementation gap detection, session lens optimization (67% efficiency gain), and recursive self-improvement capability.

**WORKING PRINCIPLES**:
- Question timeline assumptions ("could we do this faster?")
- Challenge approaches when you see better alternatives  
- Focus on working examples over theoretical explanations
- Maintain 100% redundancy between main repo and portable toolkit
- Update session continuity docs when making significant changes
- Preserve YAML frontmatter, Obsidian embeds ([[links]]), and block references (^block-id)

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**:
**ðŸ“‹ ESSENTIAL CONTEXT - FOUR CRITICAL DOCUMENTS**:
1. **`session-continuity/01-PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS.md`** - Project scope, objectives, and success criteria
2. **`session-continuity/02-SESSION-PLAN.md`** - Current active work and session focus (if no plan exists, offer to create via interview with date validation)
3. **`session-continuity/03-CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md`** - Latest project status and achievements
4. **`session-continuity/04-README-FOR-FUTURE-AI.md`** - Comprehensive AI collaboration context

**ðŸ“‹ ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (as needed)**:
- Read `session-continuity/09-CONVERSATIONAL-INSIGHTS.md` for collaboration preferences
- Apply session lens approach - focus on 4-6 items maximum per session
5. **ACTIVELY MONITOR** for these trigger phrases during conversation:
   - "That's complete" / "We've finished X" â†’ Auto-check 02-SESSION-PLAN.md checkboxes
   - "Actually, let's..." / "Change of plan" â†’ Document deviation with date validation
   - "If system were working, wouldn't X happen?" â†’ Implementation gap detection
   - "Let's wrap up" / "Session complete" â†’ Archive session and update snapshots

**USER PREFERENCES**:
- Direct, honest communication over diplomatic language
- Rapid iteration and execution over extensive planning
- Real-world validation over theoretical solutions
- System-thinking and reusability mindset
- Meta-conversation about improving the collaboration itself

Please confirm you understand this context and are ready to collaborate effectively.

## ðŸ”§ **Customization for Different Projects**

**For New Projects:**
1. Replace repository URL with actual project repository
2. Update project status to reflect current state
3. Modify working principles based on project needs
4. Adjust user preferences based on collaboration style

**For Different Domains:**
- **Technical Projects**: Emphasize testing, deployment, security
- **Documentation Projects**: Focus on clarity, structure, completeness  
- **Research Projects**: Prioritize systematic analysis, evidence validation
- **Creative Projects**: Balance structure with flexibility, iteration

## ðŸ“Š **Session Start Success Indicators**

Effective session start when:
- âœ… AI demonstrates understanding of project context
- âœ… AI references session continuity documents appropriately
- âœ… AI adapts communication style to user preferences
- âœ… AI proactively checks for session plan and current status
- âœ… Collaboration feels immediately productive and focused
