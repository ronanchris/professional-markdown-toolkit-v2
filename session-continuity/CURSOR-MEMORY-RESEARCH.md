# Cursor Memory & Rules Research
*Comprehensive analysis of Cursor's memory system, rule management, and community implementations*

## üß† **Cursor Memory System Deep Dive**

### **Memory Types & Storage Locations**

| Memory Type | Storage Location | Scope | Editability | Persistence |
|-------------|------------------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Global Memories** | Cursor cloud/app data | All projects | Cursor-managed only | Cross-session |
| **Project Rules** | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | Single project | User-editable | Git-tracked |
| **User Rules** | Auto-parsed from project rules | Display only | Indirect via rules files | Project-dependent |

### **Critical Discovery: Global Memory Cross-Project Impact**

**üö® IMPORTANT**: Removing a global memory in ANY project removes it from ALL projects.

**Example Scenario**:
- Memory: "User prefers Obsidian-specific workflow patterns"
- Action: Delete this memory while working on a React project
- Result: Memory is removed from ALL Cursor projects, including actual Obsidian projects

**Best Practice**: Be strategic about which memories to accept globally vs. keeping project-specific.

## üìú **Cursor Rules Evolution & Current Capabilities**

### **Historical Timeline**
- **Pre-2024**: Limited rule support, AI couldn't edit `.cursorrules` files
- **2024**: Introduction of `.cursor/rules/` folder system with `.mdc` files
- **2024-2025**: AI gained ability to directly edit `.mdc` files
- **Current**: Sophisticated frontmatter-based rule system with multiple types

### **Rule Types & Behavior**

| Rule Type | Frontmatter Configuration | Behavior | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|----------|
| **Always** | `alwaysApply: true` | Always included, globs ignored | Global standards |
| **Auto-Attach** | `globs: pattern, alwaysApply: false` | Attached when files match | File-type specific |
| **Agent** | `description: text, globs: blank` | Available for agent lookup | Conditional guidance |
| **Manual** | All fields blank/false | Must be manually referenced | Specialized instructions |

### **Why .cursorrules Files Are Sometimes Disregarded**

Based on community research and code analysis:

1. **Memory Priority**: Global memories can override project rules
2. **File Indexing**: Rules may not be indexed if files aren't saved/reloaded
3. **Syntax Issues**: Malformed frontmatter breaks rule loading
4. **Context Matching**: Glob patterns must match actual file paths
5. **Cache Issues**: Cursor sometimes needs developer reload to pick up changes

### **Proven Workarounds**
- Keep `.cursorrules.mdc` file open during sessions
- Use `"workbench.editorAssociations": {"*.mdc": "default"}` in settings
- Periodic "Developer: Reload Window" via Command Palette
- Combine description + globs for dual-mode rules (agent + auto-attach)

## üîÑ **Developer Reload Window Process**

**What it is**: Cursor's internal refresh mechanism for rule processing

**When to use**:
- Rules not being followed consistently
- After major changes to `.cursor/rules/` files
- When global memories seem to be interfering
- Performance issues with rule application

**How to execute**:
1. **Command Palette**: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`
2. **Type**: "Developer: Reload Window"
3. **Or**: Close and reopen Cursor entirely

## üèóÔ∏è **Community Memory Bank Systems Analysis**

### **Option 1: Memory Bank System**
**Source**: BMad's Cursor Custom Agents Rules Generator

**Structure**:
```
memory-bank/

**Structure**:
```
session-continuity/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prompts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md                           # AI navigation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-07-26-session-04-*.md       # Timestamped sessions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/                        # Reusable patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md                     # Systematic instructions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AI-RULES.md                           # Core rules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CURRENT-STATE-SNAPSHOT.md             # Project status
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SESSION-PLAN.md                       # Active session goals
```

**Advantages over Memory Bank**:
- ‚úÖ **Historical tracking** with timestamps
- ‚úÖ **Template system** with AI interview triggers
- ‚úÖ **Cross-session context loading** protocols
- ‚úÖ **Implementation gap detection**
- ‚úÖ **Portable toolkit** for multi-project deployment
- ‚úÖ **Real-time session management**
- ‚úÖ **Meta-conversation handling**

### **Professional AI Memory Extension**
**Source**: AI Memory VS Code Extension

**Features**:
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration
- Memory bank file management
- Dashboard interface for viewing memories
- Automatic Cursor configuration

**Our Assessment**: 
- Good for simple memory tracking
- Less sophisticated than our session continuity system
- Limited to basic memory CRUD operations

## üíæ **The Memories.md Question: Should We Add One?**

### **Community Memory Bank Pattern**:
Multiple memory bank systems include a `memories.md` file for:
- **Learning capture**: "What we learned from mistakes"
- **Pattern recognition**: "Recurring issues and solutions"
- **Evolution tracking**: "How our approach has changed"
- **Insight storage**: "Key realizations about the project"

### **Current vs Enhanced Session Continuity**:

**What we currently have**:
```
session-continuity/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BLOG-LEARNING-MOMENTS.md     # Meta-learning about AI collaboration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CONVERSATIONAL-INSIGHTS.md   # Collaboration patterns & preferences
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROBLEM-SOLVING-PATTERNS.md  # Systematic problem-solving approaches
```

**What memories.md would add**:
- **Project-specific learnings** (vs. meta-collaboration learnings)
- **Technical insights** discovered during development
- **Domain knowledge** accumulated over time
- **Evolving understanding** of project requirements

### **Recommendation: YES, Add Enhanced Memories**

**Proposed Addition**:
```
session-continuity/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT-MEMORIES.md          # NEW: Project-specific learnings & insights
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TECHNICAL-DISCOVERIES.md     # NEW: Technical patterns & solutions found
```

**Why This Enhances Our System**:
1. **Distinct from BLOG-LEARNING-MOMENTS.md** (which focuses on AI collaboration)
2. **Complements existing structure** without duplication
3. **Captures domain knowledge** that accumulates over project lifecycle  
4. **Provides AI with evolving project wisdom**

### **Proposed Structure for PROJECT-MEMORIES.md**:
```markdown
# Project Memories & Learnings
*Accumulating wisdom about this specific project*

## Technical Discoveries
- Insight about specific technology/framework behavior
- Performance patterns discovered
- Architecture decisions and their outcomes

## Domain Knowledge Evolution
- Understanding how requirements have evolved
- Key user feedback that changed direction
- Business logic insights

## Problem-Solution Patterns
- Recurring issues and their proven solutions
- What approaches didn't work and why
- Successful debugging strategies for this project

## Integration Insights
- How different parts of the system interact
- Dependencies and their quirks
- Deployment lessons learned
```

## üîç **User Rules vs Project Rules Mystery SOLVED**

### **Original Question**: "How did User Rules appear in my Cursor settings?"

**UPDATED DISCOVERY**: Cursor has **selective parsing logic** that only displays certain rules in the User Rules section based on **specific frontmatter configurations**.

### **Critical Research Findings**:

**1. Rules Processing Timing**:
- ‚úÖ **Rules are loaded at chat start**, not dynamically during conversation
- ‚úÖ **New rules require starting a new chat** to take effect
- ‚úÖ **Community workaround**: Add `.cursor/rules/` to `.cursorindexingignore` to prevent caching issues

**2. Selective Display Logic**:
Based on community analysis, User Rules section likely shows rules with:
- **Agent-type rules** (`description: text, globs: blank, alwaysApply: false`)
- **Always-type rules** (`alwaysApply: true`)
- **NOT Auto-Attach rules** (`globs: pattern, alwaysApply: false`)

**3. Why Some Rules Don't Appear**:
- **Auto-attach rules** with glob patterns don't show in User Rules
- **Manual rules** (all fields blank/false) don't show in User Rules
- **Malformed frontmatter** prevents rule recognition

### **Evidence from Community Research**:
- *"Rules in the .cursor/rules/ directory ending in .mdc are found and read automatically when a new chat is started"* (batzel, March 2025)
- *"The auto select and agent rules can still be very flaky and always and manual are the most reliable"* (bmadcode, March 2025)
- *"Add the rules folder to .cursorindexingignore... this helps a bit"* (bmadcode, March 2025)

## üìä **Research Conclusions & Recommendations**
