# AI Instructions - Professional Markdown Toolkit

*Systematic instructions for AI assistant collaboration*

## Core Collaboration Instructions

### Session Management
1. **Always check session-continuity/SESSION-PLAN.md first**
2. **Apply session lens approach** - focus on 4-6 items maximum
3. **Monitor for trigger phrases** automatically
4. **Update documentation** when making significant changes
5. **Validate dates** to prevent timestamp errors

### Code Modification Instructions
1. **Never remove backup functionality** without explicit user request
2. **Preserve YAML frontmatter** and Obsidian embeds ([[links]])
3. **Test changes with dry-run modes** when available
4. **Include comprehensive error handling** in all scripts
5. **Maintain cross-platform compatibility** (macOS, Linux, WSL)

### Documentation Instructions
1. **Update session continuity documents** for significant changes
2. **Maintain before/after examples** in docs/examples/
3. **Use consistent markdown formatting** (headings with spaces)
4. **Keep portable toolkit synchronized** with main repository
5. **Document deviations** using DEVIATION-TRACKING-PROTOCOL.md

## Problem-Solving Instructions

### Surgical Approach Method
1. **Listen for user expertise** about likely root causes
2. **Test specific hypotheses** rather than trying to fix everything
3. **Validate with real user data** not artificial examples
4. **Break complex problems** into testable components
5. **Think beyond immediate problem** to reusable solutions

### Quality Standards
1. **Professional-grade error messages** with recovery instructions
2. **Enterprise-ready backup systems** for all destructive operations
3. **Real-world validation** with actual user documents
4. **Comprehensive help text** for all scripts
5. **User-driven refinement** through expert observation

## Communication Instructions

### Preferred Style
1. **Direct, honest feedback** over diplomatic language
2. **Challenge approaches** when you see better alternatives
3. **Question timeline assumptions** - "could we do this faster?"
4. **Focus on working examples** over theoretical explanations
5. **Encourage meta-conversation** about improving collaboration

### Response Patterns
1. **Rapid iteration** over extensive planning
2. **Real progress** on actual user problems
3. **Efficient collaboration** without repetitive explanations
4. **Both parties challenged** and engaged in problem-solving
5. **Continuous improvement** in working relationship

## Advanced Collaboration Instructions

### Timeline Reality Checking
1. **Question initial complexity assumptions** - "Could we do this faster?"
2. **Bias toward rapid iteration** - Simple working version first
3. **Challenge 3-week estimates** - Often deliverable in hours
4. **Test assumptions quickly** - Don't over-plan before execution

### Expert Intuition Recognition
1. **Listen for domain expertise** - User often knows root cause
2. **Validate specific hypotheses** - Test user's suspicions first
3. **Don't override expert knowledge** - Technical implementation serves user insight
4. **Learn from corrections** - User feedback reveals better approaches

### Implementation Gap Detection
1. **Question system functionality** - "If working, wouldn't X happen?"
2. **Test recursively** - Use system to improve system
3. **Validate design vs. reality** - What actually works vs. what's designed
4. **Close gaps immediately** - Don't let implementation drift

### Payload Tax Management
1. **Measure computational costs** - Calculate actual token overhead
2. **Apply session lens approach** - Focus on 4-6 items maximum
3. **Calculate critical thresholds** - When benefits exceed costs
4. **Optimize scope intelligently** - Constraint rather than comprehensiveness

### Meta-Toolkit Thinking
1. **Think beyond immediate problem** - How could this help future projects?
2. **Package complete context** - Tools + knowledge + usage patterns
3. **Design for AI collaboration** - Structure for AI consumption
4. **Build reusable systems** - Turn solutions into portable patterns
