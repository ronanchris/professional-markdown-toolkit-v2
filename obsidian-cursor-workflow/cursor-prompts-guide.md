# How to Talk to Cursor: Prompts for Non-Technical Users

This guide helps Obsidian users who are new to Python, command-line tools, or Cursor itself. **Don't be intimidated** - Cursor can walk you through everything step by step!

## üéØ The Basic Workflow

**You'll have TWO windows open:**
1. **Obsidian** - Your normal note-taking interface
2. **Cursor** - Where you run scripts and get AI help

**Key principle**: You run scripts FROM Cursor, not from Obsidian. Cursor is your "command center" for vault operations.

## üó£Ô∏è Essential Cursor Prompts

### **Getting Started**

#### **"Help me set up this toolkit"**
```
I'm an Obsidian user new to Python and Cursor. I've downloaded the Professional Markdown Toolkit and want to set it up in my vault. Can you guide me through:

2. Where to put these scripts
3. How to configure the .cursorrules file
4. How to exclude scripts from Obsidian's interface

My vault is located at: [paste your vault path here]
```

#### **"Explain what this script does"**
```
I see a file called [script name]. Can you explain:

- "I'm comfortable with basic scripts"
- "I'm nervous about changing my files"
- "I want to understand what's happening"

### **Ask for Examples**
- "Can you show me exactly what to type?"
- "What should I expect to see?"
- "Can you give me a concrete example?"

### **Request Step-by-Step Guidance**
- "Walk me through this slowly"
- "What's the first thing I should do?"
- "How do I know if it's working?"

## üéØ Remember

**Cursor is designed to help you!** Don't be afraid to:
- Ask for clarification if something is confusing
- Request simpler explanations

## üåü Day-in-the-Life Scenarios

*Real-world problems you encounter and exactly how to solve them*

### **üìã "I copied content from ChatGPT/websites and now my notes have ugly extra spaces"**

**The Problem**: You copy content from ChatGPT, websites, or other apps and when you paste into Obsidian, it looks fine in preview mode but edit mode shows tons of extra blank lines and weird spacing.

**The Script**: `cleanup_markdown_batch.py`

**The Cursor Prompt**:
```
I just copied content from [ChatGPT/website/app] into my Obsidian notes and now I have a bunch of extra vertical spaces that look messy in edit mode. I think I need to use the cleanup_markdown_batch.py script. Can you:

The messy file is: [path to your file]
```

**What It Fixes**: Multiple consecutive blank lines ‚Üí single blank lines, extra whitespace ‚Üí clean formatting, malformed spacing ‚Üí proper markdown structure.

---

### **üìù "My headings are inconsistent after importing notes from [Notion/Roam/Word]"**

**The Problem**: After migrating from another tool or importing content, your headings have inconsistent spacing, some missing the space after #, different heading levels for similar content.

**The Script**: `cleanup_markdown_batch.py` + Cursor's find/replace

**The Cursor Prompt**:
```
I imported notes from [Notion/Roam/Word/etc] and now my headings are a mess. Some have #Heading (no space), others have proper spacing, and the hierarchy is inconsistent. I need to:

1. Fix heading spacing (# Heading not #Heading)
2. Standardize heading levels for similar content types
3. Make sure this doesn't break anything else

Can you help me use cleanup_markdown_batch.py and show me the right find/replace patterns to standardize my headings across [number] notes?
```

**What It Fixes**: Inconsistent heading formats ‚Üí proper markdown spacing, heading hierarchy ‚Üí logical structure.

---

### **‚ö†Ô∏è "My frontmatter is broken/missing after bulk operations"**

**The Problem**: After moving files around or using templates, some notes have broken YAML frontmatter, missing metadata, or inconsistent date formats.

**The Script**: `apply_inbox_template.py` or metadata repair scripts

**The Cursor Prompt**:
```
I was reorganizing my vault and now some of my notes have broken or missing frontmatter. I'm seeing notes without proper YAML headers, inconsistent date formats, and missing required fields like 'created' or 'modified'. 

Can you help me:
1. Identify which notes have broken/missing frontmatter
2. Use the right script to fix or add proper frontmatter
3. Standardize the date formats (I prefer YYYY-MM-DD)
4. Make sure I don't overwrite any existing metadata that's correct

My vault has about [number] notes and I use these standard frontmatter fields: [list your fields]
```

**What It Fixes**: Missing frontmatter ‚Üí proper YAML headers, inconsistent dates ‚Üí standard formats, broken metadata ‚Üí valid structure.

---

### **üîó "My bullet points and lists look terrible after copy-pasting"**

**The Script**: `cleanup_markdown_batch.py`

**The Cursor Prompt**:
```
I've been copying lists and bullet points from various sources (emails, websites, other apps) and now my notes have inconsistent list formatting. Some use -, others use *, the indentation is all over the place, and spacing between items varies.

I want to:
1. Standardize all bullet points to use - (dash)
2. Fix indentation to be consistent (2 or 4 spaces)
3. Clean up spacing between list items
4. Make sure nested lists still work properly

Can you help me run the cleanup script on my notes folder and show me what changes it will make?
```

**What It Fixes**: Mixed bullet styles ‚Üí consistent dashes, improper indentation ‚Üí standard spacing, messy list formatting ‚Üí clean markdown lists.

### **üìÖ "My date formats are inconsistent across my vault"**

**The Problem**: Some notes use MM/DD/YYYY, others use DD-MM-YYYY, some use text dates, creating chaos in Dataview queries and templates.

**The Script**: `update_date_created_to_templater.py`

**The Cursor Prompt**:
```
My vault has dates in all different formats - some notes use MM/DD/YYYY, others DD-MM-YYYY, some have text dates like "January 15, 2024". This breaks my Dataview queries and makes organization impossible.

I need to:
1. Find all the different date formats in my frontmatter
2. Convert everything to YYYY-MM-DD format
3. Make sure this works with my Templater setup
4. Not break any existing dates that are already correct

Can you help me use the date conversion script and show me how to handle this safely across my [number] notes?
```

**What It Fixes**: Mixed date formats ‚Üí consistent YYYY-MM-DD, broken Dataview queries ‚Üí working data views, template incompatibility ‚Üí proper Templater integration.

**The Script**: `apply_inbox_template_to_folder.py`

**The Cursor Prompt**:
```
I have a great template for [project/meeting/daily] notes but I have [number] existing notes that don't use the template structure. I want to add the template's frontmatter and structure to these existing notes without losing their content.

Can you help me:
1. Test the template application on one note first
2. Show me how it will merge the template with existing content
3. Apply it to the whole folder if the test looks good
4. Make sure it doesn't overwrite anything important

My template is: [path to template]
The notes that need updating are in: [path to folder]
```

**What It Fixes**: Unstructured notes ‚Üí consistent template format, missing metadata ‚Üí complete frontmatter, inconsistent organization ‚Üí standardized structure.
